# Yelp

## Intro

## Data

### Raw Data

The raw data is the Yelp dataset which can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset) and the [Yelp Website](https://www.yelp.com/dataset/).

The data comes in 6 JSON objects:
- Businesses
- Check ins
- Reviews
- Tips
- Users
- 

In order to import this data into an R dataframe, a few alterations must be made from the original JSON format:
- null must be converted to NA
- nested attributes must be flattened out

Fortunately, many packages exist that will do this conversion for you, such as _______ which we will use here.
